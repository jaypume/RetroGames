Megaman/Rockman 7 MSU-1
Version 1.0
by DarkShock

This hack adds CD quality audio to Megaman 7 and Rockman 7 using the MSU-1 chip invented by byuu. It also works with the English translation of Rockman 7
The hack has been tested on SD2SNES, bsnes-plus 073.1b and higan 094.
The patched ROM needs to be named megaman7_msu1.sfc.

Note that there's no emulator patch because the volume has been normalized to work on both emulators and SD2SNES (using +12 dBFS settings for the MSU-1 volume on Rev. F boards).
